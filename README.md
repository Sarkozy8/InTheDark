# In The Dark

In The Dark is a horror game I created for Android devices that puts a fresh twist on the genre. You wake up in a pitch-black maze and must activate generators to find your way back home. The catch? The maze is generated based on your real-world surroundings, using your GPS location, Google Maps, and Street View (within a one-mile radius).

The ending delivers a thought-provoking lesson about data sharing. But don’t worry, I don’t collect any data, and the game works perfectly fine if you prefer to keep your location private. Ready to take on the dark?
